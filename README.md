# Program for the management university.

It will be an exclusive App for teachers, and one for students who will receive anything a teacher publishes. This is to improve communication between teachers and students, even allowing questions to be asked through a special system.

This software wants to specialize in the management of activities, calls and in the management of notes by teachers. On the part of the students, we seek to create an App capable of giving the student the facility to access a secure system. This will create an opportunity so that even those who do not have a telephone or Internet access can access from any computer with this software, of course, knowing their own id and password to access their profile.

## What technologies are used for the project

Mainly, Java 17 is used with the OOP paradigm, along with the MySQL database to manage everything. For the interface, Netbeans will be used for greater ease when creating it, thanks to the drag and draw it has.

## What libraries are used for the project

At the moment, the libraries are being used: Displace (it's not in the maven repositories), but it works for simple animations. MySQLConnector and JUnit 6 for unit testing.

### **This project will work two sides of a coin:**

## On the part of the students will have

- Question system (which is through gmail).
- An algorithm that positions the most viewed at the beginning (optional).
- The choice of language and customization of titles of the program.
- A local service that will load the posts from the last time you connected to
 Internet. If it is the first time that you enter the App, it is mandatory to enter with internet so that you can save the data of what comes.
- Interface settings.
- Visualization of notes of each subject.
- Possibility of sending the activities through gmail from the App.
- A special space to be able to do your own work and add it to the App.

The student will be able to see their grades, the activities sent and upcoming activities that are already scheduled in a schedule.

## What will the part of the teachers have

- List of students (whether or not by class)
- Notes of each student
- Withdraw students (does not remove them from the records)
- Option to clean the semester record of your subject at the end of the semester
- Activities of each subject
- History of the semesters
- Observe your semester planning
- Activities to send or notify students

Teachers have much more freedom than the students themselves. These already if they wish can create or delete things that the students could not. Being that these, they must regulate where each thing will go.
